                        Light bounces off of objects into your eyes. <br>
                        The light then gets focused by your lens and gets absorbed by your rods and cones in your eyes.
                        <br>
                        These signals are then interperated by your brain and color is percived.

                        Here is a relatively simple model of human color perception. <br>
                        The sliders on the left choose what color is being transmitted into the eye. <br>
                        The sliders on the right represent the amount of rods and cones of each type. <br>
                        The color gets broken down into the activation of each then reconstructed back into a color.
                        <br>
                        This is not fully accurate as the combination here is linear and actual vision is not.

                        Not all combinations of rods and cones creates a valid color. <br>
                        An example of these are something called chimera colors. <br>
                        Chimera Colors are the combination of two colors that have no additive mix. <br> <br>
                        Below are some examples of "impossible colors". <br>
                        To see the colors cross you eyes such that the crosses overlap and try to focus on them.

                        How Far do You See?

                    <div class="section-body">
                        Depth perceiption is your ability to see how far away an object is. <br>
                        There are a few ways that this is achieved. <br>
                        One method is stereoscopic vision. <br>
                        This where mind is able to use the differences between the left and right eye <br>
                        Below is an example of stereoscopic 3D using a stereoscopy. To see the effect cross your eyes
                        like
                        in the color example. <br>
                    </div>

                    </div>

                    <div class="section-body">
                        Another way you are able to sense depth is based on context. <br>
                        We have an idea that certain obejcts are a specific size. This hints your mind with how large
                        objects should be relative to eachother and implies a depth. <br>
                    </div>

                    <div id="context" class="sketch">

                    <div class="section-body">
                        Here we can see that our ability to recognize the object implies something about our perception.
                        <br>
                        How is this possible? <br>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        Top Down / Bottom Up
                    </h3>
                    <div class="section-body">
                        Bottom Up refers to mental processes that feed up into into higher level functions. <br>
                        For vision that would would be visual data being processed then fed up into feature recognion
                        then into object recognion. <br> <br>
                    </div>
                    <div class="section-body">
                        Top Down are processes that start higher level and feed down into lower mental processing. <br>
                        This would be the recognion of what the object is and feed down into sensory recognition. <br>
                    </div>
                    <div id="bottom" class="sketch">

                    <div class="section-body">
                        Arrows to the left representing top down processing. <br>
                        Arrows to the right representing bottom up processing. <br><br>

                        As implied from context based depth perceiption, human vision works as a combination of top down
                        and bottom up processes. <br> <br>
